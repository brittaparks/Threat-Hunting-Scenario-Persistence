# Threat-Hunting-Scenario-Persistence
## Detection of Unauthorized Browser Persistence ##

## üß™ Example Scenario

A user reported that each time their system starts up, Microsoft Edge automatically opens to coinbase.com. This behavior was not configured by the user and persisted across reboots. A deeper investigation was initiated on the britt-windows10 device using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint advanced hunting. Findings suggested unauthorized registry-based persistence and suspicious PowerShell activity. Additionally, port scanning activity originating from internal IPs was observed.

## üìÖ Timeline Overview

üîç Persistence and Edge Redirection Activity

Observed Behavior: Microsoft Edge launched with coinbase.com set as the homepage on every reboot.

## üß© Detection Queries and Reasoning

1. Registry Persistence Search (Homepage Change)

To detect changes to Microsoft Edge startup behavior, I investigated if the registry was modified to include coinbase.com as a startup parameter:

```kql
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where DeviceName == "britt-windows10"
| where (RegistryKey has "CurrentVersion\\Run" or RegistryKey has "RunOnce")
| where RegistryValueData has "coinbase.com"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RegistryKey, RegistryValueName, RegistryValueData
| order by Timestamp desc`

```

Result: Registry key modified on `2025-04-15T21:38:28Z`, adding a persistence entry launching Edge to coinbase.com.

2. Process Execution Involving Coinbase

To confirm if the browser was launched via script or manual action, I searched for process executions containing coinbase.com:

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "britt-windows10"
| where ProcessCommandLine has "coinbase.com"
| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, AccountName
| order by Timestamp desc`

```

Result: Showed the actual PowerShell or browser processes launching the page, confirming automation.

3. Broader Registry Change Window

Ran a time-filtered registry query to find if the attacker added other persistence mechanisms post-homepage modification:

```kql
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where DeviceName == "britt-windows10"
| where RegistryKey has "Run" or RegistryKey has "RunOnce"
| where Timestamp between(datetime(2025-04-15T18:36:23Z) .. datetime(2025-04-17T23:36:23Z))
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RegistryKey, RegistryValueName, RegistryValueData
| order by Timestamp desc`

```

Reason: Attackers often layer persistence to maintain access. One follow-up registry entry appeared a day later.

üì° Suspicious Network Activity and Exfiltration Check

4. PowerShell-Based Exfiltration/Recon Check

I checked for PowerShell use that might indicate data exfiltration or reconnaissance attempts over non-standard ports:

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "britt-windows10"
| where RemoteIP != "internal_network_range"
| where RemotePort !in (80, 443)
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine has "powershell.exe"
| where Timestamp between(datetime(2025-04-15T18:36:23Z)..datetime(2025-04-17T23:36:23Z))
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RemoteUrl, RemoteIP, RemotePort, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc`

```

Reason: To filter out normal web activity and detect possible outbound exfiltration using PowerShell over non-standard ports.

## üß† What to Watch Out for Next

üîÑ Registry Monitoring: Continue monitoring for changes to Run or RunOnce keys.

üß† Script Launches: Track additional PowerShell executions, especially those downloading from external URLs or accessing internal ports.

üïë Scheduled Tasks: Even without specific times, tasks set to launch at startup can be suspicious.

üë§ Account Persistence: Check for new user accounts or privilege escalation attempts.

| T1046  | Network Service Scanning          | Detected scanning from internal devices        | Indicates lateral movement or recon                  |
| T1218  | Signed Binary Proxy Execution     | `powershell.exe` used for evasion              | Signed binary was used to execute hidden behaviors   |

## ‚úÖ Response Actions

üïµÔ∏è Identified and confirmed unauthorized persistence via Registry Run key

üîç Inspected PowerShell executions launching coinbase.com

üåê Verified internal PowerShell-based port scanning activity

üîí Blocked inbound connections at the firewall
